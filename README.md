# Mini Message Board

[**Made as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.**](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-mini-message-board)

A very simple message board, all done server-side using Express. View messages, and access a separate page to post a new message by providing the message and username. Pretty simple.

I probably should have spent more time improving the CSS, but whatever.
